Hey! guys, girls and other genders. Do you use the [Tinder](https://tinder.com)? If be honest I do not really like this application,  because in most of cases it just spending your time. If you don't have the premium account your profile will more rarely appear at other users. Of course, if you do not spend the 24 hours per day to this application. So I'd like to extend your knowledge how does Tinder work.
Of course there are a lot of things which are influencing to your match rate. For instance, your location, age spectrum, nationality, profession, etc. However the main components are your profile (photos, description etc) and your swipe volume. Therefore, if your photos are not exquisite, or at least attractive - your Swipe Volume can equite the disbalance made by your photos. However if you're a student or a worker you don't have a lot of time to swipe the girls or boys 24/7. So, I've created the aplication which will swipe for you. [This](https://github.com/jeffmli/TinderAutomation) guy even broke down the reward system to the formula 

![ROI](img/formula.gif)

"*The better photos/good looking you are you have, the less you need to write a quality message. If you have bad photos, it doesn't matter how good your message is, nobody will respond. If you have great photos, a witty message will significantly boost your ROI. If you don't do any swiping, you'll have zero ROI.*"
